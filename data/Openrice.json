{"preview":false,"result":{"full_description":"其實係上個月剛去完首爾，食了這家NeNe Chicken 覺得十分好味，又見葵芳剛開，就去試吓。我喺首爾是叫外賣的，今次喺香港就堂食。即日電話訂座，估唔到俾我訂到，星期五晚上8:00。當晚我們早到，未能安排座位，所以等了一陣，其實都幾多人等位，仲有人等外賣添。店內座位不多，裝潢有點像快餐店。座位較窄，但燈光明亮，服務員好快遞上餐牌，餐具。原本想叫他們幫我地換過餐碟，但見我們三隻碟都是一樣的破，心諗應該都冇幾多隻碟係完整的，就算喇，希望下次黎的時候已經換過新碟。食物方面，我們點了雙拼炸雞，分別係初雪(即是芝士)及大蔥冇骨炸雞。我覺得初雪好味啲，芝士味濃，不錯。大蔥則一般。另外叫了芝士辣炒年糕伴麵及一款都是雙併小食，芝士炒年糕併韓式豬腸炸紫菜粉絲卷。炒年糕口感QQ 的帶辣，小朋友應該食唔到。至於炸紫菜粉絲卷好似食血腸，我不太喜歡。份量對於我們三人來說，真係食唔晒，所以叫店員俾個外賣盒帶走。總結，食品都是韓國食好味啲，店員服務ok, 餐碟要換。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    ","sentiment":"ok","review_title":"香脆炸雞，辣炒年糕"}}

{"preview":false,"result":{"full_description":"自從我在將軍澳和銅鑼灣分店的烤雞餐廳「Goxxne Chxxken」，開始嘗試過韓國的烤雞全翼，和甜味的雪奶冰之後，我對韓國烤雞、韓國炸雞和雪奶冰的興趣變得越來越濃厚。或許要吃韓國烤雞，我已經找對應該要去的餐廳，但是另一方面，韓國炸雞的雞全翼固然是非試不可，但是現在想吃韓國炸雞全翼的話，我應該「跑」去哪裡吃才對？當然，韓國著名「國民MC」，綜藝節目主持人之一的劉在石，有份代言的炸雞店「NeNe

Chicken」的餐廳範圍，發現「劉在石」的氣息不算太過濃厚，餐牌上也看不見「劉大神」的蹤影，反而見到另一個跟「NeNe Chicken」有關的韓國女子組合「Gfriend」，在餐廳範圍內隨處可見。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n

   \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n「NeNe Chicken」，餐廳本身比較集中於提供炸雞，以及啤酒倒插沙冰，不像「Goxxne Chxxken」一般，有兼顧推出雪奶冰甜品。但是「Goxxne Chxxken」有些做到的事，例如只靠另上甜味醬汁的「招牌炸雞」，「NeNe Chicken」也能輕易做到。另一方面，「NeNe Chicken」的炸雞，跟很多韓國炸雞餐廳一樣，有個很重要的設定。就是他們賣的炸雞，都有分開設定有「無骨炸雞」，和「有骨炸雞」兩款炸雞給食客選擇，選「無骨」價錢會比較昂貴一點。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n

      \n        \n    \n\n    \n就連揀選「NeNe Chicken」的「雙重滋味炸雞」，也可以選擇有骨或者無骨，價錢亦是無骨比有骨昂貴。我為了第一次品嚐韓國有骨雞全翼，所以刻意點選了「雙重滋味」的有骨炸雞。至於「雙重滋味炸雞」的款式，我今次走了比較傳統的選擇，揀選了靠醬汁輔助的招牌炸雞，還有塗滿韓國辣味醬汁的「韓式甜辣炸雞」。「NeNe Chicken」本來有款他們標榜招牌菜的「初雪炸雞」，我留到下次再嚐試吧。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n

Chixxen」的招牌香烤烤雞一樣，「NeNe Chicken」的「雙重滋味炸雞」都是以一大個餐碟，盛載裝起眾多炸雞，不同部位都一應俱全。「雙重滋味炸雞」除了原隻炸雞全翼之外，還包括有雞髀肉、雞胸肉，總之大部分在雞身上能吃到的部位，都不難在「NeNe Chicken」的「雙重滋味炸雞」餐碟上找到。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n

Chxxken」的烤雞一樣，「NeNe Chicken」餐廳都會向食客提供盛載雞骨的垃圾袋、鐵桶、手套和鐵夾，方便食客食炸雞，和吃完炸雞之後，可以順利處理清除雞骨。鐵夾除了方便夾走雞骨之外，亦是方便我直接夾起炸雞全翼，以鐵夾代替餐叉，是直接食用炸雞全翼的理想工具。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n

   \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        招牌炸雞\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n把其中一件炸雞髀肉，用餐叉夾起，直接點了白色的調味醬料，炸雞髀肉立刻有了酸酸甜甜的味道，是很開胃的味道。雖然「NeNe Chicken」的招牌炸雞，是沒有塗抹調味醬料的炸雞，但加上了酸甜醬後，炸雞的口感和味道，立刻由純粹香脆和新鮮炸味，換成酸甜味的炸雞，跟甜辣炸雞的感覺完全不一樣。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n至於「雙重滋味炸雞」裡面的甜辣炸雞，味道是從我年前初次接觸韓國炸雞以來，第一次吃到的辣中帶甜的感覺。今次葵芳「NeNe Chicken」的甜辣炸雞，面頭灑上了一大片的杏仁碎，令炸雞表皮多了杏仁的香脆口感。以前我無疑是經常食到，甜醬汁的韓國炸雞，但是韓國甜辣炸雞給我的第一個感覺，往往會是甜甚於辣，多於辣甚於甜。「NeNe Chicken」反而打破了我以前的看法，還告訴我炸雞表皮還可以舖上杏仁片來食用。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n到了對我來說，食韓國炸雞最重要的一環，食炸雞全翼。由於今次我點了「NeNe Chicken」兩款韓國炸雞，所以炸雞全翼都有兩款。我抱着「寶物尋歸底」的心態，先試食招牌雞全翼。由於招牌的炸雞全翼表面沒有醬汁，所以今次每次吃炸雞都要先點一點檯面的甜酸醬汁，然後才能慢慢享受，慢慢地我忽然忘記了，先試食未點醬汁的招牌炸雞，亦是很重要的一環。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n食「NeNe Chicken」點醬汁來吃的招牌炸雞，往往第一時間讓我想起，以前在「KXC」吃限定推廣炸雞，「KXC」往往會推出一些醬汁包，而且是味道像沙律醬味醬汁包。以前我吃了炸雞加沙律醬或其他油份較高的醬汁，最後回家後都會腸胃不適，明明炸雞本身沒有問題都會是這樣。但是在我飲了，在西貢藥房開給我的中藥茶後，我的肚子已經對炸雞點油份較高的醬汁，腸胃不再出現不適。不過「NeNe Chicken」的招牌炸雞全翼，就會不刻點上醬汁，本身的口感已經很脆很有口感。再點上酸甜味道的醬汁後，只是多出了一股酸甜開胃的味道，和感覺而已。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        韓式甜辣炸雞\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n至於「NeNe Chicken」的甜辣炸雞版本的「炸雞全翼」，它的外型和味道，都跟我期待已久的韓國甜辣味道炸雞全翼，幾乎有了接近九分的相似。剩下唯一的不同，就是那先辣後甜的感覺。不過沾滿了韓國甜辣醬汁的炸雞，我吃下去得到的第一個感覺，就是甜辣醬汁塗滿炸雞，每一啖都吃到甜辣味道醬汁和滋味無窮，想把骨頭都啜乾淨的感覺。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n

Chicken」食炸雞期間，全程都找不到「劉大神」的蹤影，甚至在餐牌裡面都看不到「劉大神」。這或許要等到，我將來去到韓國旅行，食炸雞時才能看到「劉大神」的蹤影……","sentiment":"smile","review_title":"韓國炸雞全翼初體驗（說好的劉在石呢？）"}}

{"preview":false,"result":{"full_description":"［薄餅］我對韓式餐廳嘅薄餅已經唔其望特別好食, 所以已經有定心理準備, 叫咗個海鮮薄餅...個薄餅根本唔可以叫做薄餅, 只係放咗一隻手指甲咁大嘅蝦係上面嘅!蔥!油!餅!仲食到成嘴油淋淋...［炸雞］依間嘢話名係韓式炸雞店, 但我唔明點解啲炸雞可以差過K乜C, 叫咗個芝士炸雞...其實就只係係炸雞上面落一大堆芝士粉, 好...我算, 但一食落去芝士粉根本冇芝士味, 味道只係甜甜哋嘅芝士味精, 調味唔講住, 講雞, 最基本嘅炸雞係皮連雞肉一口咬落去, 皮肉不分離, 但佢件雞我一咬...塊皮已經跌咗, 証明炸粉嘅份量同炸嘅時間計算錯誤。［炒飯］全名已經唔記得...大概係叫炸雞炒飯之類, 炸雞頭先已經講咗, 不過依隻就冇落粉, 所以唔講太多, 炒飯...又係一個敗筆, 色:啡色, 雖然加咗蕃茄仔做裝飾, 但個炒飯係完全冇其他餸, 香&味:味道單一, 食完第一口已經冇意欲食第二口, 普通至極。［環境＆清潔］成間店舖有好多韓文, 比人個氣氛係好似韓國...但長時間有部電視機大大聲播k-pop韓文歌, 如果平時冇乜點聽韓文歌但又想試下韓式炸雞(好似我咁)咁你一定會聽到煩...重複又重複可能因為太大聲。講完環境講清潔, 清潔方面真係有啲令我跌眼鏡, 地面同週圍嘅環境冇大問題, 但餐具真係令我好嘔心, 先係每人都有一隻嘅鐵碗, 一望落去...勁多乾咗嘅水積印, 仲要好鬼死難沫乾淨, 之後係叉, 污糟到我以為佢冇洗過就拎出黎比人用, 我係佢個餐具兜到唸住搵過第二隻乾淨少少嘅, 點知幾隻叉都係一樣咁污糟...唔用水沫係根本唔會乾淨, 最好笑係我張幾隻污糟叉放返入個兜個陣, 同我一齊食嘅朋友話我「用完就唔好放返落去啦!」我答「用完?你睇下, 我未用都已經咁污糟啦!」［禮貌］員工禮貌其實唔錯, 幾有禮貌, 但食物一般般...服務態度再好都冇用。［價格］唔算值, 依個價錢食咁嘅炸雞...除非您超鍾意韓國啦...咁都可以試下嘅...最後, 朋友問「會唔會再去食？」我答「唔會」［完］","sentiment":"cry","review_title":"芝士炸雞味道普通，一般以下"}}

As advertised, the chicken tasted very healthy (I.e. couldn't really taste anything); the quality lies somewhere between cafe de coral and kfc at maybe triple the price.   In terms of the maki set, \"ripoff\" isn't the right word but it's the first word that comes to mind. For $100 we got about 20 pieces of supermarket take out quality maki without the fish.   The overall experience was surely an \"unbelievable dinner experience\" as stated on their menu. The bill came to $300 for worst than kfc and park' n shop quality food.  \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        &quot;KFC&quot; (with apologies to Kentucky) $108\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        Special maki set $98\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    ","sentiment":"cry","review_title":"0分-_-"}}

{"preview":false,"result":{"full_description":"Korean fried chicken is definitely not new. But BBQ Chicken Premium is one of the newer restaurants in Hong Kong serving fried chicken, K-style. The difference is that this place originates from Seoul, Korea. The country that started it all. From the menu describing their place, it claims to have started this insanity. But I think it just brought the fried chicken craze to the mainstream audience. Also, upon reading the menu, they use olive oil to fry chicken, thus claiming to be more healthier than other places.Since it's opening in Causeway Bay, there has always been a long queue. As I live near here, I noticed that the lines aren't long if you get there earlier. And that's exactly what we did as I wanted to try it.Menu is in English, Korean and Chinese with plenty of photos. But what they basically serve is various different fried chicken, snacks, drinks and desserts.Appetizers are offered: kimchi, pickled daikon and bean sprouts. These were ok though the daikon were oddly bland and not pickled. So, I'm wondering if these were not pickled after all or they just weren't pickled long enough?\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \nChicken Combo Set ($148). The interesting thing about this place is that you can order something called a chicken combo which includes three pieces of their regular golden olive oil chicken and five pieces of a sauce fried chicken of your choice for $148. Not a whole chicken so you can eat other items and still get to try two different chicken flavors at the same time. As this seemed good, we chose this and our sauce chicken was yuzu.\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \nI liked the yuzu sauce on the chicken. It basically tasted like that yuzu syrup you buy from Korean stores to make yuzu drinks. That is exactly how it tasted like and I liked it. It was super sticky and sweet. The meat was also moist and tender.\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \nThe olive oil fried chicken I didn't like. Yes, the skin was crunchy and the meat was moist. But it also tasted like I was eating a mouthful of oil. It was just way too greasy tasting.\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \nMari Combo Set ($98). I love mari. For some reason, I can eat a lot of these. As we couldn't decide on what type of mari to order, we chose the combo set. This included 8 crab mari, 8 kimchi mari, 8 bulgogi mari and 8 fried shrimp. It came with a spicy dipping sauce (which I really didn't dip because I'm not much of a dipping sauce person) and Doritos. I don't know what the chips were for but oh well...love Doritos, so can't complain. The rice was moist and sticky. Favorite flavor was bulgogi. The fried shrimp was a bit soggy. I guess the Japanese do a better job of that one. Crab was actually imitation crab meat. Kimchi was not spicy at all.

It was ok and definitely just an ooh fun moment.

A ice purple potato coffee that cost $38. Drinks all came in this fat cup so they were fairly large in size. The purple potato made the coffee very thick and creamy. It had the texture of a smoothie. There wasn't much potato flavor but it wasn't too sweet.\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \nI can see why this place is popular as it's location is quite good. It's on street level and definitely geared for the mainstream audience who want fried chicken and don't know how to go to the really niche places. I noticed they have lunch and afternoon tea sets that are reasonably priced so perhaps would return when I'm looking for something to eat and don't want to go to my usual places.","sentiment":"ok","review_title":"Korean fried chicken in a mainstream setting"}}

As the name says it all, the fried chicken has many varieties and when it comes to taste its actually pretty good. Comparable to the ones in Korea. Unfortunately their other dishes were not as good. The seafood rice was cold and also the seafood on the dish is all cold and dried.The Sushi roll was average and its definitely not the best quality compared to the fried chicken.I guess they only specialize in Fried Chicken so next time I'd probably just stick to that only\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    ","sentiment":"ok","review_title":"AWESOME CHOICES ON FRIED CHICKEN"}}

{"preview":false,"result":{"full_description":"記得呢間BBQ Chicken Premium Chicken剛剛開業的時候，排隊食炸雞的人，企滿店外的街道，依家熱潮總算有點退卻，終於可以一試佢的實力💪🏻。光顧的時間係下午茶時段，下午茶餐有兩款，我揀左麵嗰個餐，可以自由配搭，玩法有啲似車仔麵，先點麵款，再揀配料，最後係湯底。我試左韓式香蔥魚片拉麵辣湯🌶，另外加配兩件香蒜炸雞🍗（黎到炸雞店，點都要試下佢的招牌菜）。食物質素不過不失，尚算合格，炸雞唔會太乾，有juicy的感覺，而且炸漿唔會太厚，香蒜味道也很惹味。但我唯一有疑問的係餐牌上的價錢，雖然有寫明係＄35起，但成個餐牌都無寫到實際價錢係＄50，而加配的炸雞，亦由餐牌的＄15，變到＄20，最終埋單要＄77（加埋10%服務費），定係星期六、日公眾假期有附加費🤔？可能我自己都有責任，落單前要問清楚價錢啦。但我作為食客，係覺得有取巧之嫌，希望餐廳可以改善，標明價錢，以免給客人留下負面印象。總括來說，一餐要＄77的下午茶車仔麵，值唔值得真係見人見智喇！\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    ","sentiment":"ok","review_title":"韓版車仔麵"}}

\n因為是第一款辣的食物，所以有點不易應付，但吃真一點這辣也帶點甜，是韓式風味，所以也可以抵得住，之後來的辣也算不得甚麼了（除了一款...）。不過魷魚就沒有鮮味，可能因為辣味較濃，已被蓋過了。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n

\n與此同時，有一碟小伴菜出現，有青瓜及蘿蔔。在吃完較刺激的炸雞之後來這個伴菜都真不錯，它們的味道是酸酸的，是經過醃製的那種味道。但吃多一口時便可以吃到瓜的鮮味，是自己頗喜歡的，因此也把整碟伴菜在最後清了。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n

\n另一款炸雞是洋蔥炸雞，炸雞上混了很大量的洋蔥及蕃茄醬。炸雞的味道其實與之前的香辣炸雞差不多，不過有大量的洋蔥就令這味菜有點特別。洋蔥的味道不濃，相信是經過水煮，所以把濃味減輕了。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n

\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n

\n\n    \n最後品嚐的雞款食品就是香辣雞腳，也是之前提過除了它，其它都不算太辣的一款。這個辣並不是入口立即出現的，是要在慢慢品嚐食物之後，才由口的後面散發出來。但較好的是不會纏繞很久，不過那感覺也真叫人回味。另一方面，這些雞腳都是無骨的，也因這樣在初上枱時也以為它是八爪魚。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n

小明太魚\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        $88\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n這個小明太魚是用來送酒的。很乾身，有點像雞泡魚乾，但就較為淡味一點，因此在旁邊有一點調味醬。最後想來一點甜品，但店員指原來韓國沒有特別的甜品的，但為了大眾的口味，制出了這個蕃薯芝士棒，在韓國大概找不到的。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n

It is similar to the taste I have tried in LA (which was opened by the Korean), because this store is opened by Korean too! Therefore, their food are original Korean taste and flavor! Really love the Squid Legs with Cheese, because I am a cheese lover, and the combination of the fried squid and cheese is very good! The Sweet Potato and Cheese stick is worth to try, sweet and chewy, and it is freshly fried! It is really full for 2 people to finish all of them!PS.

I felt like they were somewhat frozen beforehand. \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        Fish Stick ($48)\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        $48\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \nSweet Potato Cheese Cake ($48)\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        Sweet Potato Cheese Cake ($48)\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        $48\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \nAt first I thought it was the fish stick but it's not. It also it's gonna be like mozarella stick in texture but it was more like a battered French fries with cheese flavour in it. It was soft and mashed. Each serving contains 5 pieces which was really reasonable for only $48! \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        Sweet Potato Cheese Cake ($48)\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        $48\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \nI think I should stick to their Korean Fried Chicken instead of being too adventurious.

香辣雞腳。整體而言，炸雞皮薄而脆，入口不太油膩。原味炸雞味道較淡；香辣炸雞經過調味，帶酸辣，似美式水牛鷄翼；洋蔥炸雞的醬汁酸甜，似泰式鷄醬。洋蔥和炸雞的比例各佔一半，洋蔥吸收了雞味和醬汁，比雞更入味可囗；辣芝士雞可加重芝士味，令整道菜更香，更貼題。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n

\n值得highlight的是醬油雞翼和香辣雞腳。色澤油潤的醬油均勻地黏著大隻飽滿的雞翼，加上蒜花，賣相吸引。一口咬下去，豐富的肉汁緩緩滲出，混和甜甜的醬油，再配合蒜香，口味有層次，大滿足！\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n

原味及香辣炸雞以雙拼形式上菜。原味炸雞帶著基本醃料的鹹和香脆，沒有雪藏的味道，肉質鮮嫩。辣味炸雞則是原味炸雞的升級版，多了韓式辣醬的辣和甜，辣勁之餘又不忙安慰已被辣完的味蕾。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n

早前在首爾的旅行中，在街邊小攤買過血腸來吃，當時的感受是大‧崩‧潰！充滿豬血的腥味，如何以辣醬和晶鹽也蓋不住那份味道。這次試試這個香辣血腸也帶著戰戰競競的心情去試，沒有了腥味，帶點彈牙口感，惟調味可以再重手一點，畢竟是血嘛，不重手反而失去了應有的味道。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n

辣炒魷魚飯。還是辛辣！魷魚炒得很香！很爽！很辣！送飯吃就是讚！三爬兩掃就掃清光了！一行人在狂風掃落葉下，飲飽吃醉肚滿腸肥捧著肚子走人，如果定期都能抽到時間辦一下久違的朋友聚會，相信能為沉悶的工作生活重燃多少樂趣呢！總結而言在性價比上有相榷的餘地，以碟頭來說份量不算大，相比我在首爾吃到的炸雞，同樣價錢這店大概是三分二的份量。飯麵類便宜而大份，若只是以韓食來充填肚子，飯麵類來得徹底；但炸雞在這店的確仍是鎮店NO1，新鮮嫩滑的雞肉做成炸雞的魅力相信要各位親身一試才能體會，希望店方能在價錢或份量上再作調整吧！","sentiment":"smile","review_title":"「寵寵寵」韓國雞先生"}}

{"preview":false,"result":{"full_description":"Went to try this place with gf - got there quite early so we didn't have to wait for a table at all. The place was easy to find as it was the only restaurant on that floor. The place was not very big and fancy - the decoration was also very simple with two flat screen TV constantly playing K-pop. Unfortunately, the place was not very spacious and the sitting isn't the most comfortable. There were plenty of waitresses ready to serve. Most of them were Koreans and don't speak any Cantonese. They do speak English and there were at least two Chinese, so it wasn't a big deal. We didn't have to wait long for food (probably because we were the only ones there). We had the 飯團 - it was served in a big metal bowl (typical Korean style) with sticky rice and seaweed. They also gave us a pair of gloves, evidently we had to make our own 飯團！It turned out not bad at all. But the bowl can easily feed 3-5 people so it was a bit much. We also ordered a kimchi omelette which was very nice. kimchi served with mustard and ketchup with fried egg is very unique. Lastly, we tried the fried chicken - we ordered half original and half sweet-spicy. The original was better but overall it was very good. The price was a little steep but it wasn't completely over the top. The meal was very filling and overall we were both very satisfied with the dishes. Although the place was empty, the waitress told us that there was a 90 minute time limit to our table but we got out of the place under an hour. The longest wait was the fried chicken and we thought that if the place was packed and everyone ordered their signature dish of fried chicken, I think people will struggle with the 90 min limit. On the other hand, there was a lot of discount offered if you \"Like\" or share pictures of the food on FB or instagram. Overall, I recommend trying this place definitely!","sentiment":"smile","review_title":"Nice place to try for authentic Korean chicken"}}
{"preview":false,"result":{"full_description":"Boyfriend had this weird craving for KFC but some how or other we ended up eating Korean fried chicken. KFC, I guess? I saw this was a recently opened restaurant in Causeway Bay and conveniently located in Tang Lung Street, we decided to give it a try. The reviews seemed positive. Photos looked ok. Why not?Boy, were we so deceived!The shop is small and very cramped. We were told that we had a 90 minute dinner time limit. The place was packed with people waiting to get in after we left. We noticed all the staff were Cantonese. Not one was Korean. It should have rang warning signs!Menu is in Chinese, English and Korean. It not only served various friend chicken but side orders that are good for eating with drinks.We ordered only one thing as we know that was enough for just two of us. And we were here for one thing only. Chicken. Fried. Korean style.We were given pickled daikon. This was horrible. It was not tart enough. Actually, it was just bland.

Alarms should have rang when I noticed they only gave us forks and knives for eating the chicken instead of the usual metal tongs and NO bucket to throw away our bones. This is NOT how Koreans eat their chicken! And seriously, once you use the tongs, you find that eating fried chicken with forks and knives is impractical! But that was only the formalities. How as the chicken?Terrible.It was dry. DRY. DRY!! The sauce was bland. This was worse than Red Chicken. It got to the point that my boyfriend said he couldn't eat anymore. Not due to the fact he was full, but that he couldn't eat another bite of this super dry bird. I think we both ended up not finishing it.

It's in Korean, English & Chinese. They serve about 10 different types of fried chicken, spicy chicken feet and salad. Surprisingly, they also serve a fair amount of cooked food like kimchi pancake, rolled omelet and various side dishes.For beer, they only have draft Asahi and Erdinger Weissbier. I'm surprised they didn't serve  Korean Beer (draft or not). We ordered two draft Asahi ($68 x2), Half Original & Half Spicy Fried Chicken ($168) and a Kimchi Pancake ($108)\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        炸雞 (原味和辣味)\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        $168\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \nThe batter on the original chicken was crunchy and rather tasty. However, both types of chicken were fairly dry, especially the one with the spicy sauce. The spicy sauce was more sweet than spicy. If you have to try, I suggest going for the original taste instead of the spicy sauce. These chicken chunks were a bit better than those I had at SU but less good than those at Mix & Rice and Fairyland. The best is still LI KA (HOF & SOJU). \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        泡菜煎餅\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        $108\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \nThe kimchi pancake was much better than the fried chicken. It was crispy outside and soft inside. As the name suggests, it was filled with a large amount of kimchi. At $108, this wasn't exactly cheap.\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        朝日生啤\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        $68\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \nWhat's to comment about the beer? Well, for a place with a motto like \"Beer is the best partner of fried chicken\", the beer was horrible. It wasn't fresh at all. It tasted stale and irony. My friend and I both couldn't finish more than half the beer. I suspect that either the beer has gone stale and/or they didn't clean the tap properly.Conclusion:The service was very good.However, in view of the quality of the food, this is not a place I'd really recommend. Mr Korea BBQ is much better.  ","sentiment":"ok","review_title":"【Mr. Korea Chicken】 煎餅勝炸雞 Average fried chicken"}}

{"preview":false,"result":{"full_description":"When I first heard about this place, I was instantly reminded of Burger Republic, the logos are similar too, when I saw the menu, it totally confirmed the same owner owns them.The Bailey’s milkshake is served at both places.Anyway, I came here especially for chips and curry sauce, something I haven’t had for ages, the last time I had it was in this little food stall in Stratford market in East London, I wonder if it is still there.Apart from chips with curry sauce, I also got chips with cheese and mayonnaise.The chips were nice and crispy, and the sauce was perfect especially the curry sauce.The other one with cheese sauce was also good, it is not melted cheese, but cheese sauce, similar to the one at Burger mix, except the Burger mix one is runnier.The cheese and mayonnaise were both quite thick in texture, so it covered the chips nicely.I would have loved more sauce, I love chips drenched in sauce, especially curry sauce or gravy.For drinks, had Baileys and blueberry milkshake, both were very smooth and cold, without fine ice crystals, it was light and foamy too, but weighted down by the milk.The baileys didn’t taste that strong of baileys, but it was good, and the blueberry was better than expected, it was made with real blueberries, and there were quite a few whole berries in it.Whilst we were there, they gave away samples of other milkshakes and chips, so I tried the Sesame one, I actually avoid sesame, but this one tasted really good, perhaps it was made in a British way! I could taste bits of Oreo in the Sesame milkshake, so I think that enhanced it.There were other flavours too: Strawberry, chocolate green tea, coffee, sesame, green tea.As for the chips, there were other flavours too, chilli con carne, Cajun, gravy and mozzarella.For improvement: I think the customers could be given a choice of crispiness of i.e. just crispy, crispy or very crispy, as some like it soggy, some like it crispy, and I like them crispy at the beginning and then gradually soggy by the sauce.Also there was news from the owner that Burger Republic may be re-locating, I hope they serve chips and curry sauce too, another place for me to get chips and curry sauce as well as from Elements.\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    ","sentiment":"ok","review_title":"supersupergirl woz here!"}}

Compared with my recent visit to Ireland's Potato, my gosh this was SO MUCH MORE SATISFYING! I think it fulfilled my fries craving on the spot, right after my first bite. I had to wait around 3 minutes for my fries because they prepare it a la minute. For that reason, it was really hot and fresh - important when it comes to fries, or any hot food in general (in my opinion), but of course it means more 熱氣!!! Oh well, it takes some sacrifice to experience good food, I guess. The fries: Mmmmm. Hot. Crispy on the outside. Soft on the inside. Thick and good in texture. Perfectly covered in their sauce. Doing well on this, don't need to change a thing!Chilli Cheese Sauce: Spicy!!!! Spicy enough for me, really good combination with fries and cheese. Hot, thick, well seasoned and in abundance!!! They were not skimpy with the sauce like many other stores selling fries. Their was enough sauce to cover the fries, even down to last one! This really impressed me, even though its not a big deal. Just saying...Wow, would definitely return for some more. I'm not sure if I am willing to let go of this flavour and try a new one, because I love spicy so much! I might want to try the gravy and mozzarella one, just maybe. Likes: Chilli Cheese Fries!!!Dislikes: -Come Again? YesTo Improve: Maybe something green to decorate. It doesn't look attractive enough for how good it tastes! ","sentiment":"smile","review_title":"So much better than Irelands Potato!!!!"}}

Compare with the Triple O's on the lower floor, this Chips Republic seems less expensive.The fish burger is a surprise to us.  Instead of single layer of fish, it has two layers!  The burger bun is another check point that has high density of flour.  It means it can fill more room of our stomach!  Although the fries is less attractive than the fish burger, it still has great texture - crispy & hot enough.The fish bites is deep fried small fish pieces, similar to KFC's hot shots.  It came with a tartar sauce (or plain mayonnaise?).  I wish they will offer a piece of fresh lemon for me to squeeze it on the fish of the burger.

The beef was peppered and salted, so there was a bit of a black pepper taste to it. Personally I found the beef to be overly salty. The patty itself was also a little on the thin side.

{"preview":false,"result":{"full_description":"記得年前第一次幫襯Chips Republic已經覺得價錢又貴個包又細; 雖然幾個月前知道位置重新裝修, 但仍然無再行入去的衝動.因為團購, 令我決定再試一次.其實Chips Republic並非第一次出團購, 不太記得上次是甚麼優惠(因為無買), 大概是現金券之類吧. 但今次吸引我的是$49 Fish & Chips套餐.Fish & chips這種製法簡單的菜式在香港很多地方都有, 但較'港式', 即是已預先製作好的'fish fingers', 件件都是長方體, 同一size那種, 又或者是魚扖, 即麥記魚柳包那款. 如果要大大件似外國風味的話, 就要去較高檔的西餐廳, 一份動輒都要近百蚊.是次團購網頁報稱原價是$85, 團購$49一份, 本著一試的心態買了兩份; 這篇食評是分了兩日兌換了兩次後才執筆.裝修後的Chips Republic位置大了, 座位亦多了; 依然是自助形式, 但有個pager可先找座位再等通知取食物.\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n第一次看到這份fish & chips, 嘩, 原來都幾大份, 難得是魚扖原條炸, 炸粉又不厚. 從熱辣辣及脆口程度便知是即叫即製, 魚入口亦夠新鮮夠滑. 外脆內軟, 很有質素, 可謂一試難忘.薯條則屬粗條那種, 入口同樣熱辣辣, 當然並非甚麼特別的味道, 但絕對合格有餘.\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n第二次兌換團購餐的fish & chips質素與第一次同樣出色, 相信魚扖的大小每份都差不多.\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n不過由於團購餐有限制兌換時間為非繁忙時間, 所以兩次到訪時人客都不多, 希望他們繁忙時間亦能保持質素.撇除地點等因素其實$49一份fish & chips也非特別平, 不過有如此質素我仍覺得值得一試.","sentiment":"smile","review_title":"有質素的Fish &amp; Chips"}}

{"preview":false,"result":{"full_description":"On my way home today, I decided to stop at Elements because I have neer been there before!  Then I came across this place as I was wandering around and couldn't resist the temptation to try it. Environment & Hygiene:Chips Republic is located right beside the cinema, which I thought was quite hard to find because it is hidden in the corner and almost looked as if it was part of the cinema. It had quite a unique and nice layout; with different pictures everywhere, like this one of the Beattles. \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \nHowever, I didn't like that the tables had different kinds of chairs, which made the place look messy. Maybe because it wasn't quite quiet and not busy at all, the place was quite clean and well maintained.  I enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere it had. Taste & Value:I saw a lot of people eating burgers, but I had come for Fish & Chips so I wasn't gonna change my mind.  For $85, I got a big piece of fish, some chips, some beans and a small soft drink. It didn't look like much at first, but I was very full after I was done.

The chips of course were the typcial thick cut chips. They were good as well, but a bit greasy. Also, they weren't fried too evenly. I got some pieces that were quite burnt, while some were okay. I've never had warm beans before, so I thought they were kinda weird.

To my surprise, there were a few more mixed right into the batter. I realized later that the workers were not wearing hair nets and open rice expect me critique the taste? My honest opinion, the chicken was very salty and the texture? Very hairy, it made the chicken very stringy. I may be being a little sarcastic but how do you expect me critique the taste when they didn't even took care of basic hygiene. Mind you this wouldn't be the first fried chicken joint I've had salty chicken but I was never greeted with hair shedding.

{"preview":false,"result":{"full_description":"Don't come for lunch if you want to order takeaway because you'll get no service. I walked in and was ignored by 2 staff for several minutes until I just loudly announced I would like to order takeaway. I was then told to wait. 2 other groups of people came in after me and were seated immediately and given menus while I continued to stand and wait without a menu even. 1 staff disappeared upstairs, the other stood around a while before taking the order of 1 of the tables. I continued to wait. When he went to take the order of another table while still ignoring me I finally walked out because this was ridiculous that I am waiting 10 min and not even given a menu when 2 groups can be seated, 2 groups can have their orders taken and the staff has time to stand around stacking napkins. On top of that, the ridiculous staff acted surprised that I would leave angry and tried to get me to come back! You ignore me for so long and think I would possibly want to support your restaurant?!

\n薄餅一點都唔細，兩人食其實係好飽。薄餅以水牛芝士、菠蘿、火腿同蘑菇組成。憑相入面就知有幾足料，而呢個薄餅係我食過咁耐以黎最特別。特別在於以新鮮材料製成，我並唔係認為外面其他pizza的店唔夠新鮮。只係呢間的蕃茄醬絕對唔似外面的個種蕃茄汁味，係新鮮蕃茄做，難免一開始覺得好奇怪，蕃茄酸左少少。菠蘿食落都唔似罐頭菠蘿，唔會好甜。\n    \n            \n        \n

\n\n    \n我地各人先叫左一杯飲品，一杯普通冷的柚子梳打。另一杯係芒果啤酒。芒果啤酒入口有淡淡芒果味，之後有啤酒的苦澀味。而柚子梳打則梳打味過重，影響柚子發揮。最後，我地叫多左一杯提子特飲。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n

\n飲品本身味道不錯有創意，但稍微多冰，令到最後愈飲愈淡。利賓立味道，加上梳打水以及阿菠蘿雪條的味道。喜歡的話，可以另外食雪條一杯飲品，兩個人飲都夠晒😏超大杯兩人總共消費$507。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n

\n滿心期待的特級芝士火鍋($278)出場！配料包括手工芝士流心年糕、紫薯年糕、美國豬仔骨、黃金炸薯條、腸仔及農夫包粒。原本餐牌上還有車厘茄，可是今天缺貨，於是年糕的份量加碼了。盛載芝士的鍋底，一直都有蠟燭保溫，確保保持微滾的狀態，食客可以免費加添芝士火鍋一次。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n

\n為了試真火鍋底的原味，首先以農夫包粒360°沾滿溶掉的芝士，放到嘴巴前吹一吹，然後直送口中。由藍紋芝士、金畢文芝士、巴馬臣芝士和水牛芝士融合而成的芝士火鍋底，不會太過濃稠，香氣輕輕滲出絕不霸道。個人反而喜歡這種杰度，因為當火鍋底越滾，芝士便越稠，亦越來越鹹，如今的質感便不會太膩。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n

\n相對於手工流心芝士年糕，個人較喜歡紫薯年糕，因為它的紫薯味的確出眾，甜甜地又與鹹鹹的芝士很夾。由於年糕送來時稍為堅挺，故適宜直接放進鍋內煮製，待一會後再撈起來細嚼，更能品嚐到其煙韌彈牙之感。不過年糕始終是飽滯之物，最後也未能將之完全幹掉，可惜可惜。\n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n

{"preview":false,"result":{"full_description":"首先店員邊用牙籤剃牙，邊準備飲品，睇到實在已經無胃口。我地到餐廳時，二樓空蕩蕩，只有兩個女仔(就快食完)，同老公兩人詢問店員，可否坐最角落窗邊的三人位(二樓冷氣太大，果個位其實好難坐到三個人)，到店員拒絕，話有三個book左人黎緊，作罷，表示理解(但20分鐘後，果位拒絕俾我地的入座的藍色制服男侍應俾左個位俾兩個女仔，見到佢收起左一套餐具，由比斷定booking係呃人！)。點完餐後，想要杯熱水，因為冷氣直吹，加上店內真係無咩人，越食越凍(已著住外套+頸巾)，詢問可否調細少少冷氣，再次回應，中央冷氣做唔到。OK,甘可否要杯熱水，店員再用冷漠的態度回應”我地d水係樽裝賣\"，言下之意要俾錢？！到此已經非常嬲，臨走埋單，店員竟然連goodbye都唔會講，心念間野真係服務態度點解差到呢地步！所以決定寫落黎俾大家參考，如果想同朋友，家人係度食飯，呢種服務態度，真係會好掃興。好諷刺的係重要俾甘噶態度service charge。講返野食味道，我覺得無gxxbxx口味多，太陽芝士食到兩塊後覺得好膩，可能因為冷氣好凍，芝士凍噻。因為食得真係好唔開心，破壞左星期五同老公放工後的放鬆心情！所以無影到相。","sentiment":"cry","review_title":"服務態度差到爆"}}

可能是小編食過最「芝」味derrrr～😋👍🏻 原個鐵板上陣，賣相夠晒吸引，最岩相機食先！😎 \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n

用炸雞卷起一圈圈拉絲芝士🧀，「芝」味更無窮！ 還可以切開農夫包蘸芝士吃， 真係好邪惡呀！😏 由於炸雞真的好食到無得彈， 所以我們追加了一客蜜糖芥末香蔥炸雞（$155）， 今次我們選了有骨炸雞🍗， 因為啜骨會有另一番風味， 而且貼緊雞骨的雞肉多數都比較嫩滑～😂 炸雞炸得香口鬆脆， 裏面肉質軟嫩多汁， 再淋上蜜糖芥末醬，又香甜，又惹味！  \n    \n            \n

($98)。湯面清澈，沒有一般見開的麻辣紅或油面，實在太好。喝下微辣，辣味像胡椒湯的慢慢滲透出來。娃娃菜、金菇、豆腐，簡單入味。 \n    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n

同埋芝士薯條拼芝士麵包脆脆($75)。可選辣或不辣。選了辣，辣醬淋上年糕同煙肉這個配搭蠻不錯。串起來食得也方便，最欣賞的，還是可選辣或不辣，讓吃不到辣的朋友也可嚐得痛快。另一味小食即使熱氣，也要盡一盡芝士控的精神，是必叫必食的。薯條就常見的，而麵包脆脆則非常罕見！原本是跟芝士醬的，可惜今天供應完畢，轉配辣汁。芝士粉厚厚實實蓋滿薯條和麵包脆脆，啖啖都好\"芝\"味。麵包脆脆的口感也很爽，男友差不多全吃光。可惜辣汁不是很配，但不點醬，味道也很充足。\n

{"preview":false,"result":{"full_description":"This is my first food review of from this account.  Today I want to introduce to you all this restaurant.

BEER BOMB💣。那個炸彈其實就是韓式燒酒🍶，在喝前把它整杯放進啤酒中💥。老公特別挑了最愛的1664🍺，而這邊則選用了1664的白啤酒，白啤酒⚪️跟一般啤酒的差異在於熟成後不過濾即裝瓶🍾，所以會有一點點混濁感，色澤也較白⚪️。1664的泡沫一向綿密，加上Blanc本身加了丁香及柑橘味🍊，入口傳來陣陣花果香味🌸，大大降低了啤酒的苦澀味，再加入酒香而不濃的SOJU🍶，層次感很豐富👍🏻。\n
